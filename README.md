<h1>Fizz Buzz Solutions</h1>
<p>
  Anyone who has gone for a coding job has most likely been asked to complete this test.  Now most of the ones I have been too they have limited the test to the coding launage I was using and had time contraints on it.  For example my php job required it to only use PHP and I had to complete the screen within 10 minutes.  It's been a while since I have interviewed for a Dev role so I doubt this test is still a thing.  Above are my solutions in differnt languages

<h2>Fizz Buzz Problem</h2>
<p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.</p>
